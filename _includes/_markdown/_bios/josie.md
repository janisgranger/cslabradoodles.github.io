## Columbia Springs' Clementine (\"Josie\")


### ALAA-044668


There is just one word to describe Josie and that is spunky! She is full of doodle joy and bounce. Josie has a sturdy, solid build and the most luscious, silky red coat. She has been attending obedience classes with her guardian and is proud to show off all that she can do. Josie's has passed all of her health testing and we expect her first litter to arrive in 2017.


Josie currently lives with her guardian family in Vancouver, WA.
