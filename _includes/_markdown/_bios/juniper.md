## Columbia Springs' Something Something (\"Juniper\")


### ALAA-?????

(Replace this text with Juniper's Bio) has a luscious non-shedding coat that is wonderfully soft and silky. She is a sweetie who loves to romp and play. When she’s tuckered out, this accomplished snuggler will get cozy and rest her head on your feet or jump into your lap.  Nana is a quick learner whose one goal in life is to please her humans. It’s hard to resist her adorable face and her warm personality. Nana goes to work with her guardian every day and is an adored member of the team at the office. She also recently passed the evaluation for therapy dogs at the highest level and is now working in the community.
