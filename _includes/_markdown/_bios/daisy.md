Daisy is part of an active family and is a dog on the go. She has a darling personality and is totally devoted to her 5th grade human sister who has taught her a number of tricks. Daisy has the most luxurious, thick non-shedding coat with hints of apricot on her ears and the cutest black, button nose. Daisy is just an all around great doodle!


Daisy lives with her guardian family in Vancouver, WA.
