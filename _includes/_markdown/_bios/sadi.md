<p>To put it simply, **Sadi** is a bouncing bundle of happiness. She is everybodyâ€™s friend but her greatest pleasure in life is to be with her human family including her three year old (human) best friend. When Sadi walks into a room, she is confident and friendly, visiting every person to say hello. She is a quick learner and knows all of her commands and exhibits great behavior in any situation. Her soft fleece non-shedding coat is the most beautiful golden copper color. Such a sweetheart!
<p>Sadi lives with her guardian family in Bend, Oregon.
