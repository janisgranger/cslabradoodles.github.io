## Columbia Springs' Adelyn (\"Addie\")


### ALAA-041322


Addie is personality plus! She is an instant friend to everyone she meets. Addie loves to chase the tennis ball and will usually bring it right back unless something catches her eye along the way. Having passed her intermediate obedience class with a gold star, Addie continues to work on good manners and even knows a trick or two. They don't come any more lovable or loyal than this little girl.


Addie lives at home with us in Vancouver, Washington.
