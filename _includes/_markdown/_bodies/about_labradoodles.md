In the beginning......


Labradoodles were first developed in Australia by Wally Conran of Royal Guide Dogs. He was inspired when a visually impaired woman living in Hawaii was in need of a service dog. Because her husband had allergies, Conran looked to develop a dog that was allergy and asthma friendly with the temperament of a service dog. Of the 30 Australian Labradoodles produced at Royal Guide Dogs over the years, 29 served as guide dogs. This is really quite an astounding accomplishment as the success rate for dogs entering service dog programs is usually closer to 50%.


F1, F1B, Australian, Multi-gen.....what does it all mean?


F1: These Labradoodles are considered first generation. This, in the Labradoodle breed, is a cross between a purebred Poodle to a pure bred Labrador Retriever. The results are mixed, as this is not a breeding of two "like" dogs or dogs that resemble each other. F1 Labradoodles typically are moderate to low-shedding and have a sparse-hair to fleece coat.


F1B: The addition of the "B" refers to backcross - an F1 Labradoodle bred (or backcrossed) to a purebred Poodle. Again the results are mixed, as this is not the breeding of two "like" dogs. F1B Labradoodles typically are low-shedding and have a hair or fleece coat.


Multigen Australian Labradoodle (Multigenerational): A Multigen Australian Labradoodle comes from the breeding of one Australian Labradoodle to another. Multigen Australian Labradoodles typically have a non-shedding coat if both parents are also non-shedding. These are Labradoodles whose DNA can be traced back to the original lines from Australia.


At Columbia Springs Labradoodles, we produce only Multigen Australian Labradoodles.


HAIR COAT – This type of coat is most often straight or slightly wavy but can also be curly. There is minimal maintenance on this type of coat in regards to brushing but dogs with a hair coat will most likely shed. Some will be heavy shedders, others very light shedders.


FLEECE COAT – The fleece coat is very soft to the touch and may be slightly curly to more curly. This is typically a completely non-shedding coat and a good coat type for those with allergies or asthma. Frequent brushing is suggested with this type of coat, especially if you choose to let it grow longer.


WOOL COAT – Usually a tightly curled coat that has a course texture. These coats require a great deal of maintenance if they are kept long but many people prefer to keep the coats shorter. This is typically a non-shedding coat.


All of the dogs that we produce at Columbia Springs Labradoodles have soft, non-shedding fleece coats.
