### In the beginning 
**Columbia Springs Labradoodles** is located near historic Vancouver, Washington in the beautiful Pacific Northwest. How did we get started? Having had several adored golden retrievers over the years (including a guide dog puppy), we decided to look for a dog with that same sweet personality that did not shed. While researching, we discovered information about labradoodles and now we are totally hooked! We are convinced that this is the breed that best fits our family and our home will always have a labradoodle in residence.


We got our first Australian Labradoodle while serving as a guardian family for a local breeder. Sophie is now a treasured addition to our family and we couldnâ€™t have asked for a more loving, loyal and fun companion. She visits students and hospital patients weekly as a therapy dog volunteer. In fact, Sophie has brought so much to our lives that we want to bring that same joy to other families. That's why we do what we do!

### What Can You Expect
Our specialty is breeding sturdy, medium sized Australian Labradoodles with wavy fleece coats that are non-shedding, hypoallergenic and asthma friendly. Our dogs are friendly and playful yet highly intelligent and easy to train. They love their people and become devoted companions as pets, therapy or service animals. Our dogs have proven especially patient and loving with children and live in harmony with other pets. They are definitely family friendly dogs.


The raising of our puppies is truly a family affair. Everyone is involved in their care and all that it takes to raise these precious little ones. Our puppies are born and raised in our home surrounded by all of the sights, smells and sounds of family life. As a newly retired elementary school teacher, I am able give each puppy an abundance of love and attention every day.


### Our Philiosophy
**We are not a kennel facility. Our breeding dogs live in guardian homes as cherished members of loving families and come to us when they are ready to whelp their puppies. While others have chosen to have a legion of dogs, multiple staff and even separate facilities, we have decided to remain small and home based. What else makes us different from the others?? We have only a few litters a year enabling us to give each puppy the individual attention that makes for a socially healthy and confident puppy.**

With only one litter in our home at a time, we are able to spend quality moments with each puppy every day. Raising Australian Labradoodle puppies and preparing them for your family is a huge responsibility that we take very seriously. Because our numbers are small, we have the time to shower every puppy with the love and attention that it deserves.

__When choosing our breeding animals, we carefully select for optimum health, confirmation, temperament and coat. Because we are members of the  ALAA (Australian Labradoodle Association of America), we adhere to their guidelines and requirements so that you can be assured that your puppy will be of the finest quality, derived from proven generations of healthy animals meeting the highest of standards. When accepting a new puppy into your home with all the love and devotion you have for up to 15 years, the last thing you want is the unexpected- an unhealthy, poor temperament, poor looking and/or fully shedding dog. By choosing us, you can be assured that your puppy will measure up to your expectations.__

### At Home
After you get your puppy home, we offer continual support for the life of your dog. Just email us at any time with your questions. **We want this to be one of the best experiences** for your family and will remain available to assist you as needed. Our puppy owners even have a group Facebook page where they exchange photos, information and hints about puppy raising. Some local pups also get together occasionally for play dates. It's fun to stay connected and share our experiences as we raise our doodles.


Bringing a new puppy into your home requires commitment but with dedication and consistency it will pay off a hundred times over as you create a lifetime of family memories with your labradoodle.
