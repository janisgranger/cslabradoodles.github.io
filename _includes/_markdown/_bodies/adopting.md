We are so excited that you are interested in adopting one of our wonderful puppies. Lucky puppy, lucky you!! Here's how it works:
First, please fill out a puppy application. The price for a Columbia Springs Labradoodle puppy is $2750 which includes a $500 deposit fee.

The first step is to fill out an application on our website. Once received, we will review it and then contact you to discuss your interest in adopting one of our puppies.  Once approved, you will be asked to submit a $500 deposit fee which you can mail to Columbia Springs Labradoodles.


Upon receiving your deposit, you will be placed on a reservation list for a puppy from the litter of your choice. Please note that we cannot refund deposits unless a puppy cannot be provided within your requested time frame.


Once you are on the reserve list, we will notify you when puppies are born, discuss what options are available and begin to consider possible matches for you and your family. Puppies will not be formally assigned to their new owners until they are six weeks old. After those first six weeks, we have spent many hours with the puppies and know their personalities well, enabling us to suggest a puppy that best fits your needs. We will work together to find the very best fit for the puppy and for you. We also invite you to visit our home, if possible, so that you can see the puppies in person.
When a placement has been agreed upon at six weeks of age, the final payment of $2250 will be due. That payment can be mailed to us.  Our puppies are ready for their new homes at 8 1/2 weeks of age.


Because we are a small business with only one litter of puppies in our home at a time, we are able to begin socializing your puppy in the weeks before your adoption is final. Puppies will play with each other and our other friendly dogs inside and outside, be introduced to adults as well as children, travel for short distances in the car and become accustomed to the sights, sounds and smells of a busy household. Puppies will be held and cuddled daily and will be introduced to the very beginnings of potty training with frequent trips outside and litter box training inside.  They will also become exposed to the basic grooming techniques of bathing, brushing and nail clipping.


We also conduct a Bio Sensor program consisting of 5 exercises done once a day with the pups from age 3-16 days. It has been found that with these stimulations not only are puppies able to better cope with stressful situations, and problem solve better than other puppies, but they are actually physically healthier with higher cardiovascular performance, stronger immune systems, adrenal glands and heart beats. Thus, the nickname Super Puppies has been given to those that receive this early stimulation.



In addition to the puppies, nursing momma dogs need care and attention too. Once again, because we have only one litter at a time, we are able to fully attend to the needs of our breeding dogs. Special attention must be taken in regards to providing a healthy, nutritious diet and daily exercise. We want our breeding dogs to feel comfortable and loved while in our home so that they can best meet the needs of their puppies.
We also feel it is important to have the time to meet the needs of our customers. All emails and voice messages will be answered within 24 hours. We enjoy speaking with those who are interested in adopting one of our puppies and feel it is the best way to get to know you and assist in determining if you are ready to bring a puppy into your home. We cherish the long term relationships that we have developed with our puppy owners.

We require that all puppies be picked up in person at our home or a prearranged meeting location. At present we do not ship puppies. We want our puppies to go directly from our arms to yours. We may be able to accompany your puppy on a flight to your local airport. The new owner is responsible for travel expenses. As an alternative, we can meet you at the Portland International Airport should you choose to fly in and pick up your puppy. The Portland area is a beautiful and fun place to spend a weekend. Treat yourself to a getaway in the Northwest and pick up your puppy at the airport as you get ready to head home. Just email us to arrange any alternate pickup option that best suits your needs.
When you purchase a puppy from Columbia Springs Labradoodles, not only are you getting one of the finest Australian Labradoodle puppies available, we will also include:

 	
ALAA registration

 	
four generation pedigree

 	
microchip fee

 	
2 year health guarantee

 	
first worming and vaccination

 	
health exam by our vet

 	
health record

 	
a puppy gift bag that contains a puppy toy, chew bone, leash, collar, a copy of The Puppy Primer by Patricia McConnell, a grooming comb and a blanket with the scent of your puppy's momma and litter mates


Our puppies are sold on a spay/neuter contract which requires the new owner to complete this procedure by the time the puppy is six months old. This gives our puppy families the choice of determining the timing that is right for them and allows time to consult with the veterinarian that will be taking care of the dog for his/her lifetime.


If training a puppy seems daunting to you and you just don't know where to begin, we may have the perfect suggestion for you. We can put you in touch with a local trainer who will house your puppy for 2-3 weeks. During that time, your puppy will live in the trainer's home, 24 hours a day. Basic household manners, basic obedience and potty training will be the focus. After the training period, you will meet with the trainer and learn how to continue reinforcing the skills once you and your puppy arrive at home. Let us know if this is of interest to you.


Of course, we will remain available to support you as needed as you raise your puppy. Please feel free to email at any time.
