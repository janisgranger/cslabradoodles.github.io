	                        <p>To put it simply, Sadi is a bouncing bundle of happiness. She is everybody’s friend but her greatest pleasure in life is to be with her human family including her three year old (human) best friend. When Sadi walks into a room, she is confident and friendly, visiting every person to say hello. She is a quick learner and knows all of her commands and exhibits great behavior in any situation. Her soft fleece non-shedding coat is the most beautiful golden copper color. Such a sweetheart!</p>
							<p>Sadi lives with her guardian family in Bend, Oregon.</p>
